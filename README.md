# top-calculator
After being defeated by not knowing how to do anything, I finnaly made this calculator using JS classes :)
Design is not my though :( I looked for designs in google "Designs for calculators" and coded them by myself :)
Feeling very happy about my small victory :)
I could improve the calculator (lower the count of lines of code) by changing the way I get firstNumber and secondNumber, but to refactor my code I would have to change most of it. But it is working amazing how it is now :)
